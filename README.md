Assignment 7: Data Curation and Analysis (Coding)

The goal of my project was to analyze and compare the amount of sleep student get on average compared to varying factors such as the amount of credit hours they are taking, the college or school they are in within UT. ANother factor I wanted to see what if any of these variables affected their average happiness.

The data found here today was collected through a google survey asking the following questions:

1. What college are you in at UT-Austin?
2. How many credit hours are you taking this semester?
3. How many years have you completed at UT?
4. How many hours of sleep do you get on average?
5. On a scale of 1-10 how happy are you right now? (1 = lowest)


The sample size for this data was relatively small (~50), this is not a wholistic representaiton of UT-Austin's student body
